## Quick templates for optimization libraries
# Installation
Install modules (scipy and scikit-optimize) from requirments.txt or environment.yml

## Optimizers
# Basinhopping
Basinhopping approach has a variety of minimizers available. We'll use a quasi-Netwon family of optimizers here with two examples - 1d and 2d optimization. Basinhopping can also have simulated annealing - type behavior with temperature hyperparameter.
See docs:
https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.basinhopping.html

# Bayesian optimization via scikit-optimize
We'll use 1d example with illustartions.
